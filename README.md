# Traffic_Lights_Irregularity_Detection

Project done as part of Summer_Internship.

### Problem Statement:-

  Develop a Deep learning algorithm that can detect Irregularities/Malfunctions in Traffic lights through Video Classification. 



### Requirements of the model:-

  -> The algorithm should be able to accurately identify each stage of the traffic light(red, yellow, green) even in videos taken at a angle.
  
  -> The algorithm should be able to correctly determine whether the traffic lights have any kind of malfunctions.
  
  -> It should also have a low false positive rate, so that it does not generate too many unnecessary alerts.


### Technologies Used:-

  ->Deep Learning.

  ->OPEN CV (COMPUTER VISION).

  ->YoloV8 (Ultralytics).
  
  ->Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

  ->IPython.
  
  ->moviepy (MoviePy is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing etcâ€¦)


### Model Used:-
   -> Yolov8 to detect frame by frame detection in videos to classify the Traffic Lights.

### Before and after training the model

###  Output:-

output when no irregularities

classs=True

output when irrgularity where yellow light is skipped

class=False
